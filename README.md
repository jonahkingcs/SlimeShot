# SlimeShot  
*A 2D slingshot-platformer built with Unity and C#.*


## Overview  
**SlimeShot** is a fast, physics-based 2D platformer where you control a sticky slime that **slingshots** itself across walls, platforms, and hazards to reach the top of each level before time (or rising lava ;]) runs out.

Built from scratch in Unity as my **first complete game project**, SlimeShot focuses on tight, satisfying controls, expressive pixel-art visuals, and handcrafted levels built around momentum and precision.

---

## Core Gameplay Features
- **Slingshot Controls:** Click, pull, and release to launch the slime with precision and speed.  
- **Sticky Physics:** Slime sticks to any wall it touches and can cling, slide, or drip depending on surface type.  
- **Custom Pixel-Art Environment:** Seamless castle background with tall stained-glass windows and brick textures.  
- **Aiming Arrow:** Custom pixel-art arrow that visually scales 1:1 with the maximum pull distance for clear feedback.

## Visual Style
- **Pixel Art:** Created in LibreSprite.
- **Scale:** 16 pixels per unit for crisp visuals.
